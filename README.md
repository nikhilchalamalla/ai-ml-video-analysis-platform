## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is designed to analyze video data and extract meaningful insights such as activities, scenes, and anomalies. It demonstrates how AI/ML-powered video analytics systems are architected and visualized using modern web technologies.

The platform is applicable to:
- Surveillance systems
- Sports analysis
- Traffic monitoring
- Smart city applications

## 🎯 Key Features

- 📤 **Video Upload Analysis**
- 🔗 **URL-based Video Analysis**
- 🎥 **Live Webcam Analysis**
- 📊 **Real-time Dashboard Visualization**
- 🕒 **History Tracking of All Analyses**
- 🔐 **Authentication (Sign In / Sign Up)**
- 🌗 **Dark & Light Mode Support**
- 🧠 **AI-ready Scalable Architecture**

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. User provides video input (upload / URL / webcam)
2. Analysis options are selected (activity, scene, anomaly, etc.)
3. Frontend sends request to backend using REST APIs
4. Backend processes the request and stores metadata in database
5. Dashboard visualizes insights using charts and graphs
6. History page maintains records for future reference

> ⚠️ Note: Current AI inference is simulated. The architecture supports easy integration of real ML models.
